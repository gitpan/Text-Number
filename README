Text::Number - Overloaded class for printing numbers

Provides a facility for transparently configuring numbers
to print the way you want them to.  Calculations are
always executed using the full precision of the number,
but printing is rounded to the number of places of your
choosing.

Extended printing operations (using Number::Format) are 
configurable via the format method.
